    -b:           Make a executable out of a config.
```

### You will need to first setup the config dir
To do that you just need to, use this command.
```
RapidMenu
```
And it should say "Created /home/$USER/.config/RapidMenu".

### How to use (-c) 
If you want to open a configuration, just use this command.
```
RapidMenu -c [config]

You should put the config files in the config dir. So, if you want
to make a dashboard, then call it dashboard.conf. For games, use games.conf etc.

### How to use (-b)
Just use this command, it will throw an error if incorrect.
Also, it will ask what you want to name the executable, and if it already exists.
```
RapidMenu -b [config]
```

## Configuration
It is required to have the [runner] section in the configuration.
Example:
```
[runner]
rname = "Dashboard:" (name if needed)
rtheme = "-show-icons -theme ~/.config/rofi/themes/rounded-purple-dark.rasi" (theme if needed)
rcommand = "rofi -dmenu -p" (dmenu, rofi, bemenu etc)
```
An example of something to add to the configuration.
```
[Disk] (To set the name)
names = "Disk" (To set the in the runner)
description = "You chose Disk." (No required but can be set)
